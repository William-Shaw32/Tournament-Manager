Tournament-Manager

This repository contains a Java desktop application for managing and scheduling competitive 
tournaments. The application provides tools for creating tournaments, managing participants, 
and generating feasible match schedules under practical constraints.

The project combines algorithmic scheduling with a polished JavaFX user interface, allowing 
users to configure tournaments, generate schedules, and view stats in real time.

While the project was originally created to manage ping pong tournaments, it may be applied to tournaments in any sport.

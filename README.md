Tournament-Manager

This repository contains a Java desktop application for managing and scheduling competitive 
tournaments. The application provides tools for creating tournaments, managing participants, 
and generating feasible match schedules under practical constraints.

The project combines algorithmic scheduling with a polished JavaFX user interface, allowing 
users to configure tournaments, generate schedules, and view player stats in real time.

While the project was originally created to manage ping pong tournaments, it may be applied to tournaments in any sport. 

What this project demonstrates:
- Use of greedy algorithms and combinatorial reasoning to construct initial tournament schedules
- Application of recursive backtracking to escape local minima and explore alternative scheduling configurations
- Organization of a Java project using the Maven build and dependency management format
- Design of a stateful JavaFX desktop application with responsive layout and UI reflow to support different window sizes and screen resolutions
- Implementation of drag-and-drop schedule reordering using ghost images
